# Home Assistant blueprint for the Paulmann Gent 2 remote
Blueprint for Home Assistant, that enables the use of the Paulmann Gent 2 (501.40) remote through ZHA.

It is probably also working with the Sunricher ZG2868, as stated [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/z2m-paulmann-gent-2-rgb-remote/839189). If anyone can confirm this, we could add it to the device selection.

## Features
- Define actions for every button on all scenes separately
- Bind the color wheel (scene-based) to a light, or light group entity
